    "text": "Exercise 1: Research Questions\nLet’s dig into the hikes data, starting with the elevation and difficulty ratings of the hikes:\n\nhead(hikes)\n\n             peak elevation difficulty ascent length time    rating\n1     Mt. Marcy        5344          5   3166   14.8 10.0  moderate\n2 Algonquin Peak       5114          5   2936    9.6  9.0  moderate\n3   Mt. Haystack       4960          7   3570   17.8 12.0 difficult\n4   Mt.

Try running the following chunk and simply take note of the error message – this is one you’ll get a lot!\n\n# Use the ggplot function\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to use ggplot tools, we have to first load the tidyverse package in which they live. We’ve installed the package but we need to tell R when we want to use it. Run the chunk below to load the library. You’ll need to do this within any .qmd file that uses ggplot().\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nExercise 3: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 1\nConsider some specific research questions about the difficulty rating of the hikes:\n\nHow many hikes fall into each category? most to least: 3 moderate, 2 difficult, 1 easy\nAre the hikes evenly distributed among these categories, or are some more common than others? they are not, moderate is more common and 1 is the least\n\nAll of these questions can be answered with: (1) a bar chart; of (2) the categorical data recorded in the rating column. First, set up the plotting frame:\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about:\n\nWhat did this do? What do you observe?\nWhat, in general, is the first argument of the ggplot() function?\nWhat is the purpose of writing x = rating?\nWhat do you think aes stands for?!?\nExercise 4: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 2\nNow let’s add a geometric layer to the frame / canvas, and start customizing the plot’s theme. To this end, try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\nNOTE:\n\nPay attention to the general code properties and structure, not memorization.\nNot all of these are “good” plots. We’re just exploring ggplot.\n\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#adds bars for each hike in each category\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#adds different names for the axes, making it more straightforward\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#the bars are now uncomfortably blue\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#the outlines are now macalester orange\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\")  +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#gets rid of the grey background\nExercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up\nPart a\nReflect on the ggplot() code.\n\nWhat’s the purpose of the +? When do we use it? to add different arguments/characteristics to the chart\nWe added the bars using geom_bar()? Why “geom”? because it’s shorter and easier to type than a full “geometry”\nWhat does labs() stand for? labels\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill? color is the general color, but fill is the inner layer of the bar\nPart b\nIn general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a categorical variable:\n\n\nobserved categories: What categories did we observe? the difficulty ratings of hikes\n\nvariability between categories: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others? moderate is most common with easy and difficult following it\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context. The majority of hikes in the Adirondacks have a difficulty rating of “moderate”, with “easy” and “difficult” following far behind it.\nPart c\nIs there anything you don’t like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again.\nthings arent consistently capitalized and also the colors are kind of doodoo\nExercise 6: Sad Bar Chart\nLet’s now consider some research questions related to the quantitative elevation variable:\n\nAmong the hikes, what’s the range of elevation and how are the hikes distributed within this range (e.g. evenly, in clumps, “normally”)?\nWhat’s a typical elevation?\nAre there any outliers, i.e. hikes that have unusually high or low elevations?\n\nHere:\n\nConstruct a bar chart of the quantitative elevation variable.\nExplain why this might not be an effective visualization for this and other quantitative variables. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?) 1:it looks ugly 2: theres a more even spread, not much is ot\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"red\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation\nQuantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables. Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable. It’s typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we’ve observed a particular outcome as the bar graph did above. It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We’ll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: histograms and density plots.\nHistograms are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into ‘bins’ of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:\n\nPart a\nLet’s dig into some details.\n\nHow many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet?\nHow many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet?\nPart b\nNow the bigger picture. In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a quantitative variable:\n\n\ntypical outcome: Where’s the center of the data points? What’s typical?\n\nvariability & range: How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes?\n\nshape: How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)?\n\noutliers: Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small?\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize below what you learned from the histogram, in context.\nExercise 8: Building Histograms - Part 1\n2-MINUTE CHALLENGE: Thinking of the bar chart code, try to intuit what line you can tack on to the below frame of elevation to add a histogram layer. Don’t forget a +. If it doesn’t come to you within 2 minutes, no problem – all will be revealed in the next exercise.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2\nLet’s build some histograms. Try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\n\n# creates the bars, specifies it as a histogram\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# aww the borders are now white and it much more pleasent on my eyes\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") \n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# the fill is now blue\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill = \"blue\") \n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# there are now axis labels\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# each bar is now very wide\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 1000) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# now each bar is small\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 5) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# the size is now JUST RIGHT!\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10: Histogram Follow-up\n\nWhat function added the histogram layer / geometry? geom_histogram()\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill? color is everything up to the border, fill will not include the border\nWhy does adding color = \"white\" improve the visualization? because it contrasts with the background\nWhat did binwidth do? it changes the width of each bar\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too big (e.g. 1000 feet)? you arent able to see all the bars\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too small (e.g. 5 feet)? it is rather tough to see each bar\nExercise 11: Density Plots\nDensity plots are essentially smooth versions of the histogram. Instead of sorting observations into discrete bins, the “density” of observations is calculated across the entire range of outcomes. The greater the number of observations, the greater the density! The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve always equals 1 and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range.\nCheck out a density plot of elevation. Notice that the y-axis (density) has no contextual interpretation – it’s a relative measure. The higher the density, the more common are elevations in that range.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nINTUITION CHECK: Before tweaking the code and thinking back to geom_bar() and geom_histogram(), how do you anticipate the following code will change the plot?\n\n\ngeom_density(color = \"blue\") the border will be blue\n\ngeom_density(fill = \"orange\") the interior will be orange\n\n\nTRY IT! Test out those lines in the chunk below. Was your intuition correct?\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  geom_density(color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_density(fill = \"orange\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine the density plot. How does it compare to the histogram? What does it tell you about the typical elevation, variability / range in elevations, and shape of the distribution of elevations within this range? it’s smoother, shows a more general evened out trend rather than specific marked out chunks\nExercise 12: Density Plots vs Histograms\nThe histogram and density plot both allow us to visualize the behavior of a quantitative variable: typical outcome, variability / range, shape, and outliers. What are the pros/cons of each? What do you like/not like about each? HISTOGRAM: very clear, great for conveying the direct numbers in sheets DENSITY PLOT: much better for showing the variation in the data, makes trends much more clear\nExercise 13: Code = communication\nWe obviously won’t be done until we talk about communication. All code above has a similar general structure (where the details can change):\n\nggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) + \n  geom___(color = \"___\", fill = \"___\") + \n  labs(x = \"___\", y = \"___\")\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to indent or tab the lines of code after the first line (counterexample below). Why?\n\n\n# easier to track beginning\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\ngeom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\nlabs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to put a line break after each + (counterexample below). Why?\n\n\n# makes it much more difficult to read each part \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) + labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 14: Practice\nPart a\nPractice your viz skills to learn about some of the variables in one of the following datasets from the previous class:\n\n# Data on students in this class\nsurvey &lt;- read.csv(\"https://hash-mac.github.io/stat112site-s25/data/survey.csv\")\n\n# World Cup data\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\n\nggplot(survey, aes(x = fav_temp_c)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"yellow\", bindiwth = 200000) +\n  labs(x = \"Favorite Temperature (C)\", y = \"Count\")\n\nWarning in geom_histogram(color = \"yellow\", bindiwth = 2e+05): Ignoring unknown\nparameters: `bindiwth`\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nCheck out the RStudio Data Visualization cheat sheet to learn more features of ggplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck → Commit → Push\n\n\n\nWhen done, don’t forgot to click Render Book and check the resulting HTML files.

    "text": "12.2 New stuff\nThus far, we’ve been studying one variable at a time, using univariate plots. But once we get a sense of how individual variables behave on their own, our questions often turn to relationships among variables. For example, in our hikes data:\n\nHow much time does it take to complete a hike? ——&gt; How is time related to a hike’s elevation? What about its length?\nHow does difficult rating vary from hike to hike? ——-&gt; How is difficulty rating related to a hike’s ascent?\n\n\n12.2.1 Exploring relationships\nExploring univariate patterns often sparks follow-up questions about relationships between 2+ variables. Often, but not always, variables take on specific roles:\n\n\nresponse variable: the variable whose variability we would like to explain (time to complete a hike)\n\npredictors: variables that might explain some of the variability in the response (a hike’s elevation or length)\n\nVisualizations can help explore:\n\nrelationship trends (direction and form)\nrelationship strength (degree of variability from the trend)\n\noutliers in the relationship\n\nEXAMPLE 3\nFor each pair of variables below, sketch on paper a visualization of their relationship.

In general:\n\nEach quantitative variable requires a new axis (or a quantitative scale if we run out of axes).\nEach categorical variable requires a new way to “group” the graphic (eg: using colors, shapes, separate facets, etc)\nFor visualizations in which overlap in glyphs or plots obscures the patterns, try faceting or transparency.",

Construct a plot of repub_pct_20.\nNotice that the distribution of Republican support from county to county is slightly left skewed or negatively skewed.\nWhat follow-up questions do you have?\nExercise 1: Quantitative vs Quantitative Intuition Check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nDon’t spend more than 3 minutes on this!\n\n\nBelow is a scatterplot of the Republican support in 2020 vs 2016. Notice that:\n\nboth variables are quantitative, and get their own axes\nthe response variable is on the y-axis, demonstrating how repub_pct_20 might be predicted by repub_pct_16, not vice versa\n\nTry to replicate this using ggplot(). THINK:\n\nWhat info do you need to set up the canvas?\nWhat geometric layer (geom_???) might add these dots / points for each county?

Be sure to comment on:\n\nthe strength of the relationship (weak/moderate/strong)\n\nthe direction of the relationship (positive/negative)\n\noutliers (in what state do counties deviate from the national trend? Any ideas why this might be the case?)\nExercise 4: Visualizing trend\nThe trend of the relationship between repub_pct_20 and repub_pct_16 is clearly positive and (mostly) linear. We can highlight this trend by adding a model “smooth” to the plot:\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\nPart a\nConstruct a new plot that contains the model smooth but does not include the individual point glyphs.\nPart b\nBy default, geom_smooth() adds a smooth, localized model line. To examine the “best” linear model, we can specify method = \"lm\". It’s pretty similar in this example!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\nExercise 5: Your Turn\nTo examine how the 2020 results are related to some county demographics, construct scatterplots of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent, and repub_pct_20 vs median_age. Summarize the relationship between these two variables and comment on which is the better predictor of repub_pct_20, median_rent or median_age.\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent\n\n\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age\n\nExercise 6: A Sad Scatterplot\nNext, let’s explore the relationship between a county’s 2020 Republican support repub_pct_20 and the historical political trends in its state. In this case repub_pct_20 is quantitative, but historical is categorical. Explain why a scatterplot might not be an effective visualization for exploring this relationship. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Quantitative vs Categorical – Violins & Boxes\nThough the above scatterplot did group the counties by historical category, it’s nearly impossible to pick out meaningful patterns in 2020 Republican support in each category. Let’s try adding 2 different geom layers to the frame:\n\n# Side-by-side violin plots\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n# Side-by-side boxplots (defined below)\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nBox plots are constructed from five numbers - the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value of a quantitative variable:\n\nREFLECT:\nSummarize what you’ve learned about the 2020 Republican county-level support within and between red/purple/blue states.\nExercise 8: Quantitative vs Categorical – Intuition Check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nDon’t spend more than 3 minutes on this!\n\n\nWe can also visualize the relationship between repub_pct_20 and historical using our familiar density plots. In the plot below, notice that we simply created a separate density plot for each historical category. (The plot itself is “bad” but we’ll fix it below.) Try to adjust the code chunk below, which starts with a density plot of repub_pct_20 alone, to re-create this image.\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Quantitative vs Categorical – Density Plots\nWork through the chunks below and address the comments therein.\n\n# Name two \"bad\" things about this plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n# What does scale_fill_manual do?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# What does alpha = 0.5 do?\n# Play around with different values of alpha, between 0 and 1\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# What does facet_wrap do?!\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# Let's try a similar grouping strategy with a histogram instead of density plot.\n# Why is this terrible?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\nExercise 10\nWe’ve now learned 3 (of many) ways to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable: side-by-side violins, boxplots, and density plots.\n\nWhich do you like best?\nWhat is one pro of density plots relative to boxplots?\nWhat is one con of density plots relative to boxplots?\nExercise 11: Categorical vs Categorical – Intuition Check\nFinally, let’s simply explore who won each county in 2020 (winner_20) and how this breaks down by historical voting trends in the state. That is, let’s explore the relationship between 2 categorical variables! Following the same themes as above, we can utilize grouping features such as fill/color or facets to distinguish between different categories of winner_20 and historical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nSpend at most 5 minutes on the following intuition check. Adjust the code below to recreate the following two plots.\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 1: adjust this to recreate the top plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 2: adjust this to recreate the bottom plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12: Categorical vs Categorical\nConstruct the following 4 bar plot visualizations.\n\n# A stacked bar plot\n# How are the \"historical\" and \"winner_20\" variables mapped to the plot, i.e. what roles do they play?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n# A faceted bar plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# A side-by-side bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n# A proportional bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\nPart a\nName one pro and one con of using the “proportional bar plot” instead of one of the other three options.\nPart b\nWhat’s your favorite bar plot from part and why?\nExercise 13: Practice (now or later)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecide\n\n\n\nDecide what’s best for you:\n\nTry this extra practice now.\nReflect on the above exercises and come back to this extra practice later (but before the next class).\n\n\n\nImport some daily weather data from a few locations in Australia:\n\nweather &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv\")\n\nConstruct plots that address the research questions in each chunk. You might make multiple plots–there are many ways to do things!. However, don’t just throw spaghetti at the wall.\nReflect before doing anything. What types of variables are these? How might you plot just 1 of the variables, and then tweak the plot to incorporate the other?\n\n# How do 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) differ by location?\n\n\n# How might we predict the 3pm temperature (temp3pm) by the 9am temperature (temp9am)?\n\n\n# How do the number of rainy days (raintoday) differ by location?",

But they’re not the only way to visualize the variables in our dataset.\nOptional Exercise 1: Many Categories\nSuppose we wanted to better understand how the 2020 Republican support varied from county to county within each state. Since repub_pct_20 is quantitative and state_abbr is categorical, we could make a density plot of repub_pct_20 for each state. Reflect on why this is bad.\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA facet wrap would also be bad!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  facet_wrap(~ state_abbr)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we want to compare the distribution of some quantitative outcome among many groups / categories, a ridgeline plot can be a good option. These are also called joy plots, named after the album cover for “Unknown Pleasures” by Joy Division. (Look it up!) To make a ridgeline plot, we can use the geom_density_ridges() function from the ggridges package.\n\n# Install ggridges package\nlibrary(ggridges)\n\n# Make our first joy plot\n# THINK: What DON'T you like about this?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_density_ridges()\n\n\n# Let's put the states in order by Republican support, not alphabet\n# How do you think fct_reorder works?

This was wrangled from the elections data!\n\nelections_by_state &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_by_state.csv\")\n\nFor example, we might make a scatterplot of the 2020 vs 2016 outcomes:\n\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUT this isn’t the easiest way to communicate or identify the changes from 1 year to the next.\n\n# YOU TRY\n# Start by creating a \"scatterplot\" of state_abbr (y-axis) by 2020 Republican support on the x-axis\n# Color the points red\n# Scroll to solutions below when you're ready\n\n\n# Check it out\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# YOU TRY\n# Reorder the states in terms of their 2020 Republican support (not alphabet)\n# Scroll to solutions below when you're ready\n\n\n# Check it out\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20))) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Finally, add ANOTHER layer of points for the 2016 outcomes\n# What info does this new geom_point() layer need to run?\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20))) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\") + \n  geom_point(aes(x = repub_pct_16, y = state_abbr))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflect on the following\n\nWhat do you think this plot needs? Try it! You might need to do some digging online.\nSummarize the main takeaways from the plots. Which states changed the most from 2016 to 2020? The least? Where did the Republican support increase? Where did it decrease?\nWhat other questions are you left with?",
