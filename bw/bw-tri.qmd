title: "Trivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
library(fivethirtyeight)

data(bechdel)
new_bechdel <- bechdel |>
  mutate(Result = factor(clean_test, c("nowomen", "notalk", "men", "dubious", "ok"))) |>
  mutate(half_decades = cut(year, breaks = seq(1969, 2014, by = 5)))

#|fig-alt: "A bar graph of Bechdel Test results for movies released every half-decade. More movies are passing the test with each half-decade, but only faliures due to women not talking to each other have substantially decreased"
ggplot(new_bechdel, aes(x = half_decades, fill = Result)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  labs(y = "% of surveyed movies", x = "Half Decades")
