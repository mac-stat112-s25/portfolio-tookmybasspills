Use this file to generate a professional looking **bivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
# Load data
elections <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv")

#|fig-cap: "Made by Elina Poll, 2/2025, source: https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv"
#|fig-alt: "A scatterplot of the amount of Republican county support and average rent. The lower the median rent is, the more support counties have."
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = median_rent)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(y = "Median Rent", x = "Republican Support (by county)", title = "Median Rent's impact on Republican county support")
```
